light-locker
============

light-locker is a simple locker (forked from gnome-screensaver) that aims to have simple, sane, secure defaults and be well integrated with the desktop while not carrying any desktop-specific dependencies.
It relies on lightdm for locking and unlocking your session via ConsoleKit/UPower or logind/systemd.


Requirements
============

To use light-locker with systemd, you need at least lightdm 1.7.0.
light-locker doesn't work with lightdm version 1.7.5-1.7.9


Usage
=====

After installing light-locker, it will auto start along your session and you will be able to lock your session with "light-locker -l".
This will redirect you to VT8 (assuming that your open session was on VT7 and is now kept safe by light-locker) and present LightDM's greeter for unlocking your session again.
On suspend/resume light-locker will lock the active session and redirect to the LightDM's greeter for unlocking the session again.
There is no support for gnome-settings-daemon in order to keep things slim, so you might have to add a custom keyboard-shortcut for this to work.


Building
========

light-locker different configurable dependencies and some of these require the development files to be installed.
Most of these configurations will be enabled automatically when their dependencies are available.
Here is a list of the different dependencies and there configuration flags:
  --with-gtk2: This decides between the Gtk+-3.0 and Gtk+-2.0 dependency.
  --with-systemd: This adds the support for systemd logind. This option requires the development files to be installed.
  --with-console-kit: This adds the support for ConsoleKit.
  --with-upower: This adds the support for UPower.
  --with-mit-ext: This enables the lock-after-screensaver feature. This options requires the X11 Screen Saver extension development files to be installed.
